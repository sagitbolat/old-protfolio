									<h1>sPiet<br />
									a Piet interpreter</h1>
									<p>"Piet" is an esoteric programming language created by David Morgan-Mar that aims to convert
										the form of code into abstract art. sPiet is an interpreter
										for a custom dialect of piet, with minor differences from the original
										specifications. The goal of the dialect is to improve readability of the language,
										and introduce custom palettes.</p>

								<h3>What is this?</h3>
								<p>sPiet is a command line interpreter for a custom dialect of Piet. 
									A dialect of a programming language is an extension of a base 
									programming lanuage that does not alter the base of the language,
									but aims to add and/or change certain aspect of that language.</p>
								<p>The dialect that sPiet uses aims to improve readability by enabling
									the user to specify the colors that their program uses for instructions,
									as well as simplifying how certain rules operate.
								</p>
								<p>You can find the full specifications of the dialect on my 
									<a href=https://github.com/sagitbolat/sPiet>GitHub.</a>
									The original specification can be found on David's 
									<a href=https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html>website.</a>
								</p>

								<h3>Why is this?</h3>
								<p>The original Piet language is very unique. It sets out to convert
									the act of creating programs into an act of creating abstract art,
									and it achieves that goal perfectly.
								</p>
								<p>The problem I saw with the original specifications is the limited nature of it.
									David provides you with a rainbow of 6 different colors, with 3 shades for each color.
									Any color that does not lie on that rainbow is ignored.
									My dialect aims to let the user decide which colors they want to code with.
									This is done by allowing the option for the user to privide a simple "Palette" image
									which the interpreter then uses to determine what RGB values the "rainbow" will hold.
								</p>
								<p>Additionally, the dialect introduces a 21st color, which is used to stop the runtime
									the program. The base specification only stops execution once the program becomes "stuck".
									This type of setup requires the user to construct a large structure to ensure the program
									stops when the user needs it to.
									With this change, the user can stop the program with only a sigle command, rather than an
									entire structure of commands.
								</p>

								<h3>How is this?</h3>
								<p>The entire project is implemented using python. The OpenCV and NumPy libraries were used for image
									processing. An alternative was to use the Pillow library, but OpenCV proved to yield better
									performance. The ArgParse library was used to implement command line arguments for the interpreter.
								</p>
								<p>Because of the nature of Piet, the majority of the project uses a functional paradigm.
									However, due to the language using a stack in order to hold data, and a pointer object that moves
									across the image, some object oriented design was necessary.
								</p>
								<p>The project itself is broken into 3 components. The stack is used for holding and operating on the data 
									and the pointer. The parser is used to process the image one pixel at a time. Finally the interpreter
									takes the user's input, passes it to the parser, and collects the data produced by the parser, converts
									it to useful data for the stack, and feeds to the stack.
